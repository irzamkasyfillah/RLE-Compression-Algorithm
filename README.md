# RLE_Compression_Algorithm
Matlab RLE Compression Algorithm

Matlab RLE implementation(Compress , deCompress) and calculate ratio.
//Compress file

Firstly you  will run this code in Matlab and save file in your path.
You call Compress('in your image') function then write your image variable in function value.
You will see the variable(*compressData) in your window

//deCompress file
You will run this code in Matlab and save file in your path.
You call deCompress('compressed data ') function and write compressed image variable in your function.
Example *deCompress(compressData)
Finally samepic variable is your deCompressed image

//calRatio

You will call calRatio function() and you will take the first value is original image and the second variable 
is Compressed image variable. 
Variable ratio is your compressed ratio.
